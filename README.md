# React TODO App

Lab 26

In this lab, you will be creating a ToDo application, utilizing functional components and the Hooks API

Your ToDo application should have the following features:

- Users should have access to a form where a new ToDo task can be added. This form should have the following fields:
  - Task Description / Text
  - Assigned To
  - Status (complete or incomplete)
  - Difficulty (a number between 1 and 5)
- When users submit their new task form, they should see their task appear in a list of current tasks. This list should allow you to select any task to toggle it from complete to incomplete or vice versa.
- For this lab, your application does not have to persist tasks after application reload / refresh.
- The title on the browser tab should update to show the number of incomplete tasks. For example, the title could read “4 Incomplete ToDo Items” or something similar.
